# terminal_games

Just a little project to help me learn some of the ins and outs of Rust. I'm a C# developer by trade so I'm sure most of my code here is too "object-oriented"y for hardcore Rustaceans but I'm trying to pull my head out of that space :).

## minesweeper

Trying to emulate the original game in terminal using emojies and unicode characters.
